          <p>TriVita CEO and Founder Michael R. Ellison has a mission. He wants to help people everywhere experience whole-person wellness. “Wellness is having the energy and vitality to do the meaningful and important things in your life — to have daily positive emotions of love, forgiveness, gratitude and acceptance, and to feel connected to God and His purposes for your life. We have an amazing body, and when it’s given the right balance of nutrients and nurturing, it can release the healing power within to optimize wellness.”</p>

          <p>For Michael, this mission became crystal clear when he experienced a personal health crisis at the age of 50. As he recovered and found his way back to health, he became determined to share his message of wellness with others. This led to his founding of TriVita in 1999, where he now leads the company’s ongoing pursuit of bringing health and wellness to the world.</p>

          <p>Helping people experience greater wellness and mitigate the unwanted, unnecessary lifestyle-related diseases continues to be Michael’s purpose, and he brings this passion to the table in the day-to-day operations at TriVita. “We can live an exciting life filled with wellness and have the vitality to do the things we love and are purposed to do.”</p>
